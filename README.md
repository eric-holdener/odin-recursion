# odin-recursion

Recursion is a really interesting topic to learn, and I really enjoyed it.

Surprisingly, the fibonacci sequence has always given me trouble doing it non-recursively. I just couldn't wrap my head around it. I actually started with the logic behind the fibonacci sequence recursively to help me create the incremental way of determining it, which helped alot.

Merge sort was another difficult problem to work around for me. Specifically, the merge step of the merge sort - recursively splitting the arrays was not an issue, but merging them together took a while to wrap my head around.

One thing that these recursive exercises really demonstrated was the importance of pseudocode in the code planning process. If I hadn't written out the functionality in pseudocode, I doubt I would have been able to wrap my mind around it as well as I did.
